## TopGoaler

TopGoaler is an awesome 'competitive' task app that helps you achieve goals together with your friends. 


## Setup

Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies. 

Then run `expo start` to get your app running. 

To run the test server, use `node test_server/server.js`.

Download 'Expo' client on your iOS/Android device to run it natively (over the cloud too). 

VSCode is the suggested editor. Please use it in development to make sure lintings are followed.



## Contribute

Before implementing a new task / bug fix / refactor etc..., please first mark the corresponding trello card as "in progress". If there's no corresponding card, please create one for yourself.

Then make a new branch for the implementation:

```bash
git checkout -b branch_name
```

For branch_name, please follow the format:

- type-card_number

For example, task-30, bug-21, refactor-25. 



After implementation, push the commited changes to Github

```bash
git push [--set-upstream ...]
```



When the work is complete and already pushed up, create a pull request on Github to merge it into master branch. We require 2 peer reviews and passing CI before merging in.
